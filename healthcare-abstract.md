# Healthcare Data Challenges in Building a Multi-Disease Prediction System

## Abstract

Electronic health records (EHRs) have transformed healthcare data availability, yet developing robust multi-disease prediction systems faces significant obstacles including heterogeneous data formats, extensive missing values, and severe class imbalances where rare diseases remain underrepresented. This study addresses these fundamental challenges through an integrated computational framework that combines advanced preprocessing methodologies with collaborative learning approaches. We implemented iterative imputation algorithms tailored for clinical data, standardization protocols for multi-institutional data harmonization, and adaptive sampling techniques to address disease prevalence disparities. The framework incorporates privacy-preserving mechanisms enabling secure collaboration across healthcare networks without compromising patient confidentiality. Evaluation across five healthcare institutions encompassing 45,000 patient records from cardiovascular, diabetic, respiratory, neurological, and oncological domains demonstrated substantial improvements in predictive performance. Our approach achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89 across all disease categories, representing a 12% enhancement over conventional single-institution models. Notably, prediction accuracy for minority disease classes improved by 28% compared to baseline methodologies, validating the effectiveness of our class balancing strategies. These findings demonstrate that systematic addressing of data quality challenges significantly enhances multi-disease prediction reliability while maintaining privacy standards. The framework provides practical guidance for healthcare organizations implementing predictive analytics and establishes foundations for scalable, privacy-conscious disease prediction systems in clinical environments.
